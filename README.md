# DeskHiderM

A straightforward program written in AutoHotkey (AHK) that empowers you to seamlessly toggle the visibility of your desktop icons with a middle mouse click. This is a fork of [DeskHider](https://github.com/iandiv) that hides the desktop icons with a double-click. As my desktop double-click is used by other software, I decided to make a minor adjustment and use a middle mouse click instead.
